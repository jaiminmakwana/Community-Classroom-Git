fetch all commits and changes from where you forked the code
checkout to your main branch containing forked code and type,
git fetch --all --prune  #this will fetch all the changes and removed files into your main branch
git reset --hard upstrem/main  #this will reset all the commits has been done on source code 
git push origin main  #push all these changes in your main branch
